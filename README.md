# Kohana CouchDB Client

Kohana CouchDB Client hopes to provide a simple API for working with Apache
CouchDB from the Kohana PHP web framework.

This project is currently being developed against:

* [CouchDB][] 0.10.0
* [Kohana][] 3.0.7 (current stable tag)
* [Kohana REST Client][] HEAD

This project aims to closely follow the same general spirit of the Kohana
framework itself as regards code organization, in-line documentation, and code
formatting. To this end, suggestions are welcome.

[Kohana]: http://kohanaframework.org/
[Kohana REST Client]: http://github.com/sheatrevor/kohana_rest_client
