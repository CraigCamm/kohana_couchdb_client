# Kohana CouchDB Client

Kohana CouchDB Client hopes to provide a simple API for working with Apache
CouchDB from the Kohana PHP web framework.

This project is currently being developed against:
* Kohana 3.0.7

In anticipation that one day this work may be included in the Kohana mainline,
this project aims to closely follow the same general spirit of the Kohana
framework itself as regards code organization, in-line documentation, and code
formatting. To this end, suggestions are welcome.
